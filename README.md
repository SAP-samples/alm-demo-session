# Session ID - Session Title

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2023 session called XP261 - Observability for your SAP BTP Applications with SAP Cloud ALM.  

SAP Cloud ALM provides a new Data Collection Infrastructure that offers a standardized way to collect monitoring data using Open Telemetry. With this, instrumentation efforts for your PaaS applications on SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment are reduced to a bare minimum. Get an overview of the concept and learn how to instrument your applications â€“ and how this results in monitoring data coming up in SAP Cloud ALM applications like Exception Monitoring, Health Monitoring, and Real User Monitoring.

## Overview

In this session, you will learn how you can instrument your custom-built applications on SAP BTP Cloud Foundry so that monitoring data is sent to SAP Cloud ALM. 

You will be provided with a small demo Node.js application which you will instrument, build, and deploy on an SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment. After you deploy your application you will go to SAP Cloud ALM and observe the metrics delivered to Real User Monitoring and Health Monitoring.
