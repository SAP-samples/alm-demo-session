# Getting Started

In this exercise, you will gather important information to execute your exercise.

## Find your Group Number

During this Teched exercise, you will instrument a Java application and deploy it into an SAP BTP subaccount. You will then activate the monitoring for this Java application in a shared SAP Cloud ALM.

Please check the sign on your table. The number on this sign is your place number.
