# Exercise 4 - Observe Metrics in SAP Cloud ALM

In this last exercise, we will finally observe the metrics we created in SAP Cloud ALM.
The metrics sent by the custom application are attached to the SAP BTP Cloud Foundry environment in which the app is running.

## Exercise 4.1 Check metrics in Real User Monitoring

Go to your [SAP Cloud ALM](https://xp261-9kx159xc.eu10.alm.cloud.sap/launchpad#Shell-home) tenant.

Click "SAP Cloud ALM for Operations" -> "Real User Monitoring"
<br>

The SAP BTP Cloud Foundry environment in which your instrumented app is running is already in scope for Real User Monitoring.

On the Overview screen, you can see the card of your SAP BTP Cloud Foundry environment. In the card, you see an overview of the collected metrics.
Click on the name to drill into the details.

## Summary

You've now reached the end of this hands-on exercise. You have successfully instrumented a custom BTP application and enabled it to send metrics to SAP Cloud ALM. 

In this hands-on session, you instrumented a custom-built Node.js application. You can also instrument your custom-built Java applications. You can find more information on how to do this in the [SAP Cloud ALM for Operations Expert Portal](https://support.sap.com/en/alm/sap-cloud-alm/operations/expert-portal/data-collection-infrastructure.html).

Congratulations!
